        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The easiest way to make a delicious, nostalgic, and home-cooked meal is
            to make pasta with meat sauce. This dish has so much flexibility because
            the type of pasta, the type of meat, and the type of sauce can be so 
            easily substituted.

            This recipe will use ground beef, red sauce, and spaghetti, however, using
            alfredo sauce will lead to a very creamy pasta, and using ground turkey is
            my preferred method. Nonetheless, we shall begin.
