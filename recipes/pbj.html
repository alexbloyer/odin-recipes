        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the most classic and infamous meal.
            It requires 3 simple ingredients: bread, peanut butter, and jelly. In its
            simple form it is a sandwich made for children, however, it can very easily
            be enhanced to new heights with the addition of a few small ingredients and
            adjustments.

            By using a more exquisite nut butter, such as almond butter or sunflower seed
            butter, in combination with a light dusting of cinnamon powder, a drizzle of
            honey, and some time spend on a pan after being lightly buttered, a transformation
            occurs. The simple PB&J takes on new attributes and ascends to the immortal realm
            of sandwiches, alongside such as the blt, the tuna salad sandwich, and the hot
            pastrami on rye to name a few.
